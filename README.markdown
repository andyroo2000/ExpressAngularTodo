# Really, another todo app?

Yes.

# What have you done here

This is just me killing two birds with one stone and getting more familiar with both Angular.js and Express.js.

I created the todo app in Angular.js and then decided that I should create an API and POST, PUT, etc. when adding items on the front end, which adds some persistence if you refresh the page.

# What haven't you done?

I didn't make it save to a mongo database and I didn't make user accounts. I learned what I wanted to learn and I didn't feel like spending too long making a stupid todo app.
